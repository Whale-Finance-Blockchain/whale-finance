## Decentralized Asset Management

whale.finance basically implements Decentralized Asset Management with ERC 6551. We want to give the opportunity to investors sees their money been managed with full security and auditability.

## The Idea

This project uses ERC 6551 to allow managers to hold assets from investors. In this way, we can basically make a descentralized asset management using EVM. The platform is designed for the two publics: The investors, who will be able to invest their tokens in really great funds around the work in a safe way, and the managers, who will be able to manage and hold investor tokens and can have a profit to themselves.

- Overview of the project with a focus on the decentralization aspect and the role of ERC 6551.
- Importance and benefits of decentralized asset management.
- Insights on security and auditability features of the platform.
