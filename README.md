#Whale Finance - Superhack 2023

Decentralized Asset Management with ERC 6551. We want to give the opportunity to investors sees their money been managed with full security and auditability.

## The idea

This project uses ERC 6551 to allow managers to hold assets from investors. In this way, we can basically make a descentralized asset management using EVM. The platform is designed for the two publics: The investors, who will be able to invest their tokens in really great funds around the work in a safe way, and the managers, who will be able to manage and hold investor tokens and can have a profit to themselves.

## Our app deployed



## Technology

Frontend: We used typescrit + tailwind css + vite.js to deploy more fast and be adjusted to our web3 project, that does not have backend

Contracts: We use  ERC 6551 to allow managers to hold assets from investor, and control them.
